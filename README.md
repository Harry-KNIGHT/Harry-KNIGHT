I've made several contributions to open source, to tools such as [Control Room](https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom/pulls?q=is%3Apour+author%3Aharry-knight), and participating in code review of differents projets like [Swift Foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-foundation), [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).
