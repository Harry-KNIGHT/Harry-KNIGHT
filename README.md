Hi, I'm Elliot, a passionate visionOS and iOS software developer at **Decathlon Digital**.

I've made several contributions to open source, to tools such as [Control Room](https://github.com/twostraws/ControlRoom/pulls?q=is%3Apour+author%3Aharry-knight), and participating in code review of differents projets like [Swift Foundation](https://github.com/apple/swift-foundation), [SwiftLint](https://github.com/realm/SwiftLint).

I'm deeply passionate about SwiftUI and Vision Pro, dedicating my days to crafting innovative iOS apps for my job. In my spare moments, I eagerly immerse myself in the world of visionOS development, actively working on projects destined for learning and for App Store launch.
